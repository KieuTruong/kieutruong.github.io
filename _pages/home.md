### Welcome

<p>

#### Welcome to my academic webpage.

I am Thuy-Kieu Truong (Kieu), a Postdoctoral Researcher in Materials Science and Energy Engineering, with research interests centered on carbon nanostructure–based materials for energy storage and conversion, advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production, and optothermal/photothermal materials.<br />

My work integrates mechanism-driven materials design, scalable synthesis, and multi-physics characterization to develop functional materials for real-world energy and environmental applications.<br />

I am particularly interested in translating fundamental insights into practical, durable, and scalable technologies, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration across materials science, energy engineering, and applied physics.<br />

### About me

<p>
I am a materials scientist specializing in energy materials and electrochemical energy systems.<br />

I received my bachelor’s degree in Materials Science from Vietnam National University and went on to earn my Ph.D. in Energy Science from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea.<br />

My doctoral research focused on carbon nanotube sheets and yarns for energy storage, liquid crystal display devices, and smart actuators.<br />

After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a tenure-track researcher at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hanbat National University, where my research centers on advanced electrocatalysts for energy production, carbon nanostructure–based super-black and photothermal materials, and scalable nanomaterials engineering.<br />
