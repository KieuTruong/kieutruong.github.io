### Welcome!

Welcome to my academic webpage. 
I am Thuy-Kieu Truong (Kieu), a Postdoctoral Researcher in Materials Science and Energy Engineering, with research interests centered on carbon nanostructure–based materials for energy storage and conversion, advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production, and optothermal/photothermal materials.
My work integrates mechanism-driven materials design, scalable synthesis, and multi-physics characterization to develop functional materials for real-world energy and environmental applications. 
I am particularly interested in translating fundamental insights into practical, durable, and scalable technologies, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration across materials science, energy engineering, and applied physics.

### About me

I am a materials scientist working in the field of energy materials and electrochemical energy systems.
I received my bachelor’s degree in Materials Science from Vietnam National University and went on to earn my Ph.D. in Energy Science from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea.
My doctoral research focused on carbon nanotube sheets and yarns for energy storage, liquid crystal display devices, and smart actuators.
After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a tenure-track researcher at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hanbat National University, where my research centers on advanced electrocatalysts for energy production, carbon nanostructure–based super-black and photothermal materials, and scalable nanomaterials engineering.
