   abstract = {We introduce an experimental setup for the simultaneous measurement of axial and radial strain variations of a hybrid carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn actuator, where a paraffin wax is melt-infiltrated inside the CNT yarn. Such a hybrid yarn system has been known as a Joule-heating-driven tensile/torsional actuator due to a large volume expansion of the infiltrated paraffin upon a solid-to-liquid phase transition. During the operation of this actuator, however, the axial strain variations along the yarn axis and the diameter change of the yarn, which is the radial strain variations perpendicular to the yarn axis, had been measured separately, which prohibits the exact understanding of the whole actuation dynamics. In the new experimental configuration, a laser scan micrometer is employed for the in situ yarn's diameter measurement and is combined with the conventional tensile actuation measurement setup for real-time data-taking during the actuation. When the hybrid CNT yarn was tested, the synchronized strain variation data in the axial and radial directions were obtained, which helps the analysis of these actuation phenomena especially in the intermediate states.},

The characteristics of two terminal quantum Hall conductance appeared clearly on the background of a huge conductance hysteresis during a gate-voltage sweep for a device using monolayer graphene as a channel,hexagonal boron-nitride flakes as a tunneling dielectric and defective silicon oxide as the charge storage node. Even though there was a giant shift of the charge neutrality point, the deviation of quantized resistance value at the state of filling factor 2 was less than 1.6% from half of the von Klitzing constant. At high Landau level indices, the behaviors of quantum conductance oscillation between the increasing and the decreasing electron densities were identical in spite ofa huge memory window exceeding 100 V.

In the microscopic view, the NbN nanowires are formed on top of individual CNT fibrils, and the superconductivity property of the twist-spun NbN-CNT yarn system is comparable to that of a typical NbN thin film on a normal solid substrate. Because of its intrinsic porosity, the system exhibits superior mechanical flexibility with a small bending radius. It also remains a superconducting state even when subjected to severe mechanical deformations, primarily due to the proximity superconductivity through carbon nanotube bundles. The results demonstrate the possibility of fabricating flexible superconducting yarns in a conventional thin-film deposition process, using ultraflexible free-standing CNT sheets as a template. In addition, preliminary tests on reducing the normal-state resistance toward superconducting cable applications are presented.},

   abstract = {Amorphous catalysts possess substantially better catalytic activity toward water splitting than their crystalline counterparts. However, researchers have thus far focused on the crystalline rather than the amorphous phase due to the complexity of synthesis and characterization. Here, crystalline-to-amorphous transformation and charge redistribution induced by Fe and F double substitution on 3D Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheet arrays are reported as a highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea-assisted water electrolysis. It is unveiled that the synergistic effect of F and Fe dopant incorporation not only alters the electronic configuration for improved intrinsic activity but also creates abundant active sites rich in Ni3+, which are responsible for significantly accelerated reaction kinetics. First, our findings show that the collected F-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits excellent urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity with an overpotential of 1.42 V to generate 250 mA cm(-2). Then, the as-prepared catalyst can play a dual role in a whole cell test, presenting a cell voltage of 1.68 V, which is 140 mV lower than that in the overall water-splitting system at 200 mA cm(-2). This work contributes a novel approach to synthesizing Ni-based materials for bifunctional electrocatalysts with enhancement of the catalytic activities of the UOR and the hydrogen evolution reaction.},

   abstract = {In various wearable energy storage devices, the shape of fiber or yarn has many advantages owing to their compatibility with the environment in which they are deployed. We present a systematic approach to maximizing the capacitance of a supercapacitor yarn by significantly increasing the yarn's surface area by growing a high density of nanomds around the yarn, followed by coating the surface with a pseudo-capacitive material. The two-step strategy is implemented using a dry-spun carbon nanotube yarn-based electrode, which is surrounded by a zinc oxide nanorod forest that is coated by a pseudo-capacitive nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide material. The flexible as-prepared electrode exhibits a maximum capacitance of 1065 mF cm(-2) (1278 F g(-1)) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and an excellent capacitance retention of 60.5% over 7000 cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). The outstanding performance of the composite yarn supercapacitor can be ascribed to the enhanced ion accessibility to the deep surface of the nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide layer through the porous carbon nanotube yarn. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor configuration demonstrated nearly 100% capacity retention at a bending angle of 150 degrees.},

However, the sluggish kinetics of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains an excellent challenge for large-scale applications, especially in industrial-level current densities. Here, we report a general strategy to activate three-dimensional (3D) NiCoP hollow nanorod arrays through boron doping, creating high-valence metal centers that are favorable for the water dissociation step. It has been found that the 3D B-NiCoP hollow nanorod arrays can drive a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 90, 90, and 98 mV in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. The 3D B-NiCoP hollow nanorod array electrocatalyst manifests excellent long-term stability under a high current density of 113 mA cm(-2) for more than 85 h in freshwater and seawater electrolytes. Moreover, the 3D B-NiCoP hollow nanorod array electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity and stability in natural seawater. The study reveals that the exceptional performance for HER is attributed to the high-valence metal centers catalyst, abundant active sites, and efficient charge transfer of the unique 3D structure.

Electron-deficient metal-active sites can prompt electrocatalytic activity by improving the adsorption ability of intermediates. However, it remains a significant challenge to synthesize highly abundant and stable electron-deficient metal-active site electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a general approach to synthesizing a hollow ternary metal fluoride (FeCoNiF(2)) nanoflake array as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). We find that the F anion withdraws electrons from the metal centers, inducing an electron-deficient metal center catalyst. The rationally designed hollow nanoflake array exhibits the overpotential of 30 mV for HER and 130 mV for UOR at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability without decay events over 150 h at a large current density of up to 100 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the assembled urea electrolyzer using a bifunctional hollow FeCoNiF(2) nanoflake array catalyst requires cell voltages of only 1.352 and 1.703 V to afford current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are 116 mV less compared with that required for overall water splitting.},

   abstract = {Liquid crystal needs alignment layers for achieving a monodomain in which there is one specific orientational direction in a region as large as the aligning surface. The process is easy and well controlled but still needs care for avoiding contaminations that can spoil the alignment. Carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets are an attractive alternative for obtaining alignment of liquid crystal along one direction, which is the nanotube orientation. The degree of alignment of the tubes is however not as high as desirable and some tubes protrude from the common orientation direction, deteriorating the alignment and electro-optic performance of the liquid crystal. The realization of cells based on aligned CNTs in sheets in which the liquid crystal is uniformly and unidirectionally aligned are presented here. For realizing the substrates for the cells it was needed to improve the adhesion of the sheets on the glass surfaces with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and ethanol treatment, and the flatness by using a silicon dioxide (SiO2) coating. The order parameter S of these CNTs is measured by anisotropic absorption giving a value comparable to the one typical of nematic liquid crystal.},

   abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets can have several functionalities, acting as transparent electrodes and more interestingly, as alignment layer for liquid crystals (LCs). Their flexibility, and mechanical strength make them ideal for flexible electronic applications. For this use, one aspec bt that needs to be addressed is their implementation with polymer substrates. The realization of the C NT films is quite easy, but a good adhesion between CNTs and substrates is not trivial. Here we explore the use of various polymer substrates focusing on the adhesion of the nanotubes on top. By using ethanol we improve the adhesion forcing the nanotubes to lie completely on the surface. However, this is at the expense of a decrease in orientational order of CNTs, which is detrimental for using them as aligning layer for LC. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has the best performance among the tested polymers, but it still shows a decrease in orientational order after deposition. Nevertheless, the CNT-PMMA substrates were able to impose some homogenous alignment on the nematic LC (4-Cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl, 5CB) proving that aligned CNT sheets are suitable for a variety of electro-optic applications with LCs.

   abstract = {Recently, the development of environmentally friendly etch-free micro-printed circuit boards with fine-line traces has garnered significant attention. A novel photonic-assisted fabrication method is introduced that utilizes ultraviolet (UV) light and intense pulsed light (IPL) to produce highly conductive silver films on flexible substrates. Although silver organometallics can be reduced by the heating effect from localized surface plasmons (LSPs), this process alone is inefficient. Introducing zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) under UV illumination leverages their photocatalytic activity to accelerate Ag+ reduction, enabling faster film formation than silver-only samples However, the resulting films initially exhibit relatively high resistivity (377.77 microOmega cm) due to insufficient light intensity. To address this, IPL is utilized to facilitate the reduction and sintering process. Optimizing IPL power and ZnO NP thermal uniformity produced ZnO/Ag films with low resistivity (6.3 microOmega cm) and fine lines (37.46 microm) in seconds, while suppressing defects typical of Ag-only films. The resulting films demonstrate excellent mechanical and oxidative stability. Its conductivity arises from the synergistic interaction between the plasmonic resonance of silver and the photocatalytic activity of ZnO NPs, with the former also amplifying the latter. This tunable, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly method is promising for photonic-integrated flexible systems and organic light-emitting diodes.},

At high current density, the NiRh-Cu NA/CF catalyst also exhibits an outstanding performance, where 300 mA cm(-2) can be obtained at an overpotential of 155 mV and shows a slight fluctuation in the current density over 30 h.},

   abstract = {Metal node engineering, which can optimize the electronic structure and modulate the composition of poor electrically conductive metal-organic frameworks, is of great interest for electrochemical natural seawater splitting. However, the mechanism underlying the influence of mixed-metal nodes on electrocatalytic activities is still ambiguous. Herein, a strategic design is comprehensively demonstrated in which mixed Ni and Co metal redox-active centers are uniformly distributed within NH(2)-Fe-MIL-101 to obtain a synergistic effect for the overall enhancement of electrocatalytic activities. Three-dimensional mixed metallic MOF nanosheet arrays, consisting of three different metal nodes, were in situ grown on Ni foam as a highly active and stable bifunctional catalyst for urea-assisted natural seawater splitting. A well-defined NH(2)-NiCoFe-MIL-101 reaches 1.5 A cm(-2) at 360 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 0.6 A cm(-2) at 295 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in freshwater, substantially higher than its bimetallic and monometallic counterparts. Moreover, the bifunctional NH(2)-NiCoFe-MIL-101 electrode exhibits eminent catalytic activity and stability in natural seawater-based electrolytes. Impressively, the two-electrode urea-assisted alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cell based on NH(2)-NiCoFe-MIL-101 needs only 1.56 mV to yield 100 mA cm(-2), much lower than 1.78 V for alkaline natural seawater electrolysis cells and exhibits superior long-term stability at a current density of 80 mA cm(-2) for 80 h.},

   abstract = {Rational modification of the chemical components of the metal-organic framework (MOF) is one of the most promising and challenging strategies to alternate noble metals in the electrochemical water-splitting field. Multimetallic MOFs have emerged as excellent materials for several applications; however, it remains a significant challenge to synthesize and characterize these materials. In this work, we report a facile approach to synthesizing a series of multimetallic MOF nanosheet-assembled hierarchical flower-like morphologies as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for natural seawater electrolysis. Simultaneously, their three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures and multimetallic components can provide abundant active sites, improve intrinsic catalytic activity, and facilitate electron transfer. Consequently, the obtained RhCoNi-MOF exhibits overpotentials as low as 40, 48, and 50 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline freshwater, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater. In natural seawater, the RhCoNi-MOF also offers an outstanding performance comparable to Pt/C. Impressively, a two-electrode overall seawater electrolysis device using RhCoNi-MOF as a bifunctional catalyst requires a voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and can stably maintain over 80 h. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior electrocatalytic activity of the RhCoNi-MOF can be attributed to the synergistic effects of introducing Co and Rh metal ions.},

   abstract = {Urea-assisted natural seawater electrolysis is an emerging technology that is effective for grid-scale carbon-neutral hydrogen mass production yet challenging. Circumventing scaling relations is an effective strategy to break through the bottleneck of natural seawater splitting. Herein, by DFT calculation, we demonstrated that the interface boundaries between Ni2P and MoO2 play an essential role in the selfrelaxation of the Ni-O interfacial bond, effectively modulating a coordination number of intermediates to control independently their adsorption-free energy, thus circumventing the adsorption-energy scaling relation. Following this conceptual model, a well-defined 3D F-doped Ni2P-MoO2 heterostructure microrod array was rationally designed via an interfacial engineering strategy toward urea-assisted natural seawater electrolysis. As a result, the F-Ni2P-MoO2 exhibits eminently active and durable bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER in acid, alkaline, and alkaline seawater-based electrolytes. By in-situ analysis, we found that a thin amorphous layer of NiOOH, which is evolved from the Ni2P during anodic reaction, is real catalytic active sites for the OER and UOR processes. Remarkable, such electrode-assembled urea-assisted natural seawater electrolyzer requires low voltages of 1.29 and 1.75 V to drive 10 and 600 mA cm(-2) and demonstrates superior durability by operating continuously for 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2), beyond commercial Pt/C RuO2 and most previous reports.

Here, we report crystalline Ru-decorated MOF-derived amorphous CoMo-LDH nanosheet arrays as highly active and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for natural seawater electrolysis. Benefiting from the abundant interfaces, the Ru-CoMo-LDH catalyst exhibits excellent activity toward OER under fresh and natural seawater, in particular; it requires only 257 and 406 mV overpotential at 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH + Seawater, outperforming the benchmark RuO2. In addition, this electrocatalyst is an eminently active and stable HER in various electrolytes, emphasizing its outstanding bifunctional capability. Strikingly, in full-cell overall water splitting in natural seawater test, Ru-CoMo-LDH parallel to Pt/C exhibits superior electrochemical behavior (i.e., overpotential of 1.5545 and 1.731 V to obtain the current density of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively) and high stability. These excellent electrocatalytic activities highlighted the synergistic effects of intimated amorphous/crystalline junctions, which provide a rich population of exposed active sites and enhance electron transport. This, in turn, lowers the adsorption energy barrier of intermediates, leading to improved performance. Our work proves that designing an amorphous/crystalline heterointerface is a promising platform for further enhancing the hydrogen generation efficiency.},

   abstract = {Dopant-induced electron redistribution on transition metal-based materials has long been considered an emerging new electrocatalyst that is expected to replace noble-metal-based electrocatalysts in natural seawater electrolysis; however, their practical applications remain extremely daunting due to their sluggish kinetics in natural seawater. In this work, we developed a facile strategy to synthesize the 3D sponge-like hierarchical structure of Ru-doped NiCoFeP nanosheet arrays derived from metal-organic frameworks with remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in natural seawater. Based on experimental results and density functional theory calculations, Ru-doping-induced charge redistribution on the surface of metal active sites has been found, which can significantly enhance the HER activity. As a result, the 3D sponge-like hierarchical structure of Ru-NiCoFeP nanosheet arrays achieves low overpotentials of 52, 149, and 216 mV at 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2) in freshwater alkaline, respectively. Notably, the electrocatalytic activity of the Ru-NiCoFeP electrocatalyst in simulated alkaline seawater and natural alkaline seawater is nearly the same as that in freshwater alkaline. This electrocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic properties with outstanding stability under a high current density of 85 mA cm(-2) for more than 100 h in natural seawater, which outperforms state-of-the-art 20% Pt/C at high current density. Our work provides valuable guidelines for developing a low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for natural seawater splitting.},

Moreover, such a window with the user's control to ensure privacy could be obtained by the electrical power. Thanks to the horizontally aligned carbon nanotube (CNT)-sheet-like-film from drawable CNT forest, the CNT-sheet was employed as the Joule-heating induced transparent heater to modulate the transmittance change of paraffin corresponding to its solid to liquid phase change. A facile approach was used to fabricate the sandwich-like smart window cell from the CNT-sheet-paraffin nanocomposite. CNT-sheet from the CNT forest was transferred on the glass substrate and then densified by ethanol. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and infrared (IR) thermal mapping microscopy were carried out to characterize the uniformity of the aligned-CNT-sheet. Significantly, the IR microscopy results showed its homogenous Joule-heating generation without any hot spot. The sandwich cell was made from the CNT-coated substrates and was infiltrated by the melted paraffin in between the substrates. UV-vis spectra with electrical power DC application were used to measure such smart window structures. The results showed the Joule-heating induced uniform heat generator of CNT sheet driving the solid to liquid phase change of paraffin, increasing the transmittance of the intelligent window cell six times in the visible light range. Those results have shown promise for developing the facile smart window, especially for the curve window of vehicles.},

Combining CNT-based inherent light absorption and the 3D mogul pattern with micro-cavities effectively captures a broad spectrum of light from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) of (250-1500) nm, achieving an average absorption of 98%. Uniform CNT distribution in Ecoflex elastomer on the 3D mogul pattern reduces stress concentration, ensuring a robust, elastic platform.

Under a 1-sun solar simulator, the structure's photothermal effect is evident, reaching 74.6 degrees C. The floatable nature of the composite makes it ideal for solar desalination, achieving a 0.52 kg m(-2) h(-1) evaporation rate under 1-sun.

For the first time, the work presents carbon nanofiber-based black coating on commercial anodized Al(6061), which facilitates the development of a highly effective route to directly integrate the carbon-based material on the common substrate for optical baffles. The scalable and available structural engineering effect is synergized with the anodized Al(6061) coating with black dye composed of nickel catalyst and the intrinsic broadband light absorption of the CVD-grown carbon material to ultimately achieve a superior broadband light absorber. Nickel catalysts embedded in anodized Al(6061) offer a practical pathway for carbon nanofiber growth through CVD without additional stacked catalysts. The CVD-growing mechanism and CNF nanostructures are demonstrated through TEM and EDS element mapping, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy. CNF-grown Al(6061) substrates offer above 99% broadband light absorption and low light reflectance below 1% in UV-vis-NIR and mid-IR ranges. This facile approach has been useful for super black coating on Al(6061)-based complicated sculptures, such as concave substrate and an optical baffle.

Anodization and sealing treatments facilitate in situ Ni catalyst incorporation into the porous oxide layer, eliminating the need for external deposition. Notably, black anodized Al(6061) introduces a Cr-rich surface layer, which enhances catalyst stability and CNF growth uniformity. The presence of the Cr-Ni interface improves coating robustness under mechanical agitation and UV exposure, confirming its role in structural stabilization. Optimized growth parameters produce dense, vertically aligned CNFs with broadband, omnidirectional absorption, averaging 99% across 300-2500 nm and 98.5% from 2500-15,000 nm. Electrical conductivity, confirmed through four-point probe measurements, supports antistatic functionality. The coatings exhibit hydrophobicity, confirmed by water contact angle measurements, providing resistance to moisture and surface contamination. When applied to optical baffles, the CNF coating reduces stray light by over 10 dB compared to conventional black anodized coatings, as verified by BRDF-based LightTools/Zemax simulations and experimental validation across multiple angles of incidence. This multifunctional coating platform offers a practical, high-performance solution for aerospace optics, energy harvesting, and thermal management systems, where broadband absorption, mechanical durability, and environmental resilience are essential.},
